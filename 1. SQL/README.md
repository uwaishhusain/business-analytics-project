## Example Business Query

### 1. Which branches contribute the most to total transaction value?

**Why this matters:**  
Helps management identify high-performing branches and compare performance across locations.

```SQL
SELECT b.branch_name, SUM(t.amount) AS total_transaction_value
FROM transactions t
JOIN customers c ON t.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN branches b ON c.branch_id = b.branch_id
GROUP BY b.branch_name
ORDER BY total_transaction_value DESC;
